      A Torn Piece of Paper From A Brown Paper Bag
    </div>
    <img src="assets/imgs/paper.png" alt="bag" class="responsive">
    <p class="sec" style="text-align:center;">  I actually downloaded a png from Internet because I do not wanna take a picture and not having it in transparent background, but it grasped the essence of the bag that I use to protect my film rolls and camera from X-Ray. It has been folded many times and always being forgot in some corners, I need it pretty much every time I travel and I do not feel like buying a new one. It still works. And there are some tags that are becoming obscure from time to time, some writings using markers to distinguish. </p>
